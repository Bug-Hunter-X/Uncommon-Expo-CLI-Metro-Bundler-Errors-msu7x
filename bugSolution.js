The solution will depend on the nature of the specific error.   Common fixes involve correcting file paths, updating or reinstalling dependencies, or clearing the Expo cache.  The example below illustrates one common scenario where an incorrect file path causes the error. 

**bug.js (Incorrect File Path):**
```javascript
import Component from './components/MyComponent.jsx'; // Incorrect path

// ... rest of the component
```

**bugSolution.js (Corrected File Path):**
```javascript
import Component from './components/MyComponent.js'; // Corrected path

// ... rest of the component
```

This fix simply corrects the file extension from `.jsx` to `.js`.   Thorough examination of the error messages and logs from the Metro bundler is key to finding the specific cause in each individual case.
