# Uncommon Expo CLI Metro Bundler Errors

This repository demonstrates a common yet elusive error encountered when using the Expo CLI and its Metro bundler. The error manifests in various ways, often involving system-level errors rather than explicit code issues within your application.  This example illustrates the troubleshooting process and solution.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `expo start`. 
4. Observe the error in the Metro bundler output.

## Troubleshooting Steps

* **Verify File Paths:** Double-check all file paths within your app, particularly in imports and require statements. Incorrect paths are a frequent cause of these errors. 
* **Check Dependencies:** Ensure all dependencies listed in your `package.json` are properly installed and compatible with each other.  Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to refresh dependencies.
* **Clear Cache:** Clean your Expo cache using `expo prebuild --clean`.   Sometimes cached files can conflict with the current state of your project.
* **System Environment:** Verify that your system meets the minimum requirements for Expo. Correct permissions, sufficient disk space, and a properly configured Node.js environment are crucial.
* **Restart Device/Simulator:** Restarting your development device or simulator can resolve temporary issues.
* **Restart Computer:**  Occasionally, a system restart is required.
* **Review Log Files:** Examine the logs produced by the Expo CLI for more specific error details.
