This error typically occurs when using the Expo CLI and you encounter issues with the Metro bundler, the JavaScript bundler used by React Native.  It is often seen during development when building or running your application. The exact error message might vary, but often includes references to Metro bundler failures, such as `invariant violation`,  `Error: ENOENT`, or other system errors related to file paths or permissions.  This can stem from several underlying problems, such as incorrect file paths in your app, conflicting dependencies, or issues with your system environment (like missing node modules or incorrect permissions).
